# Print Guide

Hardware version: Pilot Run

Everything has been tested in PLA+ or equivalent.  

Drive gears would be ideal with really good PLA, such as [overture pla professional](https://overture3d.com/products/overture-pla-professional-filament), but PLA-CF is too abrasive and should not be used for gears. Brims are outer brims only unless otherwise specified. If you are printing in an enclosed core-xy, maybe you don’t need brims, but on a bedslinger you do. 

### Screw tool

 - 100% infill. print on side with a brim.

## Anchor Assembly (4x)  
Print four anchors total, you can select either the corner, flat-left, or flat-right variant. Corner variants are meant to be mounted in a wall corner. Flat variants are mounted on a flat wall, with the camera either looking 45 degrees to the left or the right. The camera needs to face into the middle of the work area. Examine your space and determine which types you need. The back plate and cover parts are the only part that differ between the variants.

For example, the following room would require two corner variants, a flat left variant, and a flat right variant.

There are sacrificial objects on the sides that support a 1 layer bridge.  
You should remove them and trim away the bridge after printing  
A brim is not necessary, and would be hard to remove from the narrow areas of this part, except for around those sacrificial supports. Because they are small and isolated and could become detached.
